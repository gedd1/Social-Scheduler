A mobile application for Android users that enables them to plan their weekly schedules and exchange segments of their routines in a social media format. Users can engage with shared routines by liking or commenting on them, enabling routines to be organized based on the number of likes they receive. Essentially, the app combines scheduling functionality with social features, which is why it's called "Social Scheduler."

## Objectives
- **Scheduling**: The project aims to provide personalized weekly schedules, allowing users to efficiently manage their tasks and incorporate others' routines that align with their own. We promote breaking tasks into manageable parts for better time management.

- **Social Environment**: We create a self-improvement platform within a social setting. Users can evaluate schedules through likes, dislikes, and comments, gauging their effectiveness based on community feedback.
- **Sharing Advice**: Our goal is to foster collaboration among users in experimenting with various routines to achieve goals. It's a cooperative environment where users can assist each other in the process.
- **Unlimited Content**: The app serves various purposes. For example, students preparing for exams can integrate successful study routines shared by others. Fitness enthusiasts can discover and incorporate liked workout routines into their own schedules.
- **Broad Audience**: Our app benefits anyone seeking efficient time management. It's for those who want to create, share, and seek help with their schedules, fostering a supportive community of users.
